# Anti-Hate
Project Management for the City Tech contribution to the CUNY Anti-Hate campaign

The three-year CUNY Anti-Hate Initiative confronts hate in the United States. Each year focuses on a different target population
* 2023-24 Asian-American, Pacific Islander, and Jewish communities
* 2024-25 Hispanic and African-American communities
* 2025-26 Islamic and LGBTQ communities

In the 2023-24 academic year a variety of initiatives were launched and executed.  This information is mostly codified at the [Anti-Hate Web site](https://sites.google.com/view/citytech-ccsd/home).
   
Focusing this year on African-American and Hispanic culture we hope to break chains of stereotyping, prejudice, and violence through multi-disciplinary actions.  This Project is to organize the maigerial and administrative components of this initiative.  It will include resource allocation, scheduling, and personal assignments.
