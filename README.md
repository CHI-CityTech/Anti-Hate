# Anti-Hate
Project Management for the City Tech contribution to the CUNY Anti-Hate campaign

The three-year CUNY Anti-Hate Initiative confronts hate in the United States. Each year focuses on a different target population
* 2023-24 Asian-American, Pacific Islander, and Jewish communities
* 2024-25 Hispanic and African-American communities
* 2025-26 Islamic and LGBTQ communities

In the 2023-24 academic year a variety of initiatives were launched and executed.  This information is mostly codified at the [Anti-Hate Web site](https://sites.google.com/view/citytech-ccsd/home).
   
Focusing this year on African-American and Hispanic culture we hope to break chains of stereotyping, prejudice, and violence through multi-disciplinary actions.  This Project is to organize the maigerial and administrative components of this initiative.  It will include resource allocation, scheduling, and personal assignments.


# CHI / Anti-Hate Repository Specification

## Overview

This specification provides a structured approach for organizing and managing the **Anti-Hate Initiative** within the **CHI** GitHub Organization. The repository is designed to facilitate clear tracking of tasks, maintain organized documentation, and coordinate outreach, logistics, and advertising efforts for the April 2024 event.

## Repository Structure

The **Anti-Hate** repository will be organized as follows:

```
### Sub-Project Structure (Template)
Each sub-project folder under /sub_projects will follow a standardized structure to ensure consistency across different projects. A sub_project_template folder can be used to duplicate and initialize new sub-projects.

```plaintext
sub_project_template/
├── README.md                     # Overview, goals, and outcome type (performance, exhibition, etc.)
├── docs/
